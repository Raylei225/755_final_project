# 755 Final Project: State-level Firearm Trend Prediction

## Predict state-level background check number (NICS) of firearm via neural network

This repository contains the final project for course of PSYCH-755: Environments and Tools for Large-scale Behavioral Data Science at University of Wisconsin at Madison. The project focuses on predicting state-level NICS of firearm, which serves as the proxy of firearm sale trend, using neural network. Two types of neural network were applied in this project: long short term memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network and customized deep learning neural network (in progress), the latter of which contains our focal predictor Google search trend (gtrend) and multiple other features.
